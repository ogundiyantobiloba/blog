# About

Hi I am Toby,

I write Go, build backend systems, and mess with cloud-native tools. This blog is a dump of what I'm learning or breaking â€” from containers and distributed systems to testing and automation.

I like reliable systems, clean code, and figuring things out the hard way. I treat this blog as a working notebook, not a portfolio â€” thinking in public, mistakes and all.

I spend a lot of time diving into open-source projects to understand how things really work under the hood. I believe in learning from real-world code and the engineers behind it â€” and contributing back when I can.

> This isnâ€™t a showcase. Itâ€™s a dev log â€” full of trials, errors, and the occasional insight.
