## About Me

I am a server-side developer focused on building cloud native infrastructure and distributed systems. I thrive on
solving complex challenges using Go, Docker, and Kubernetes. I enjoy creating secure, scalable, and resilient systems
that power modern applications. My work predominantly falls within the DevOps space, where I design, implement, and
maintain robust infrastructure solutions. My passion drives me to explore innovative cloud native technologies and
continuously improve my craft.

I earned a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity, which laid a solid foundation in IT and security principles. My academic
journey was further enriched by computer networking certifications that sharpened my understanding of network
architectures and communication protocols, serving as a cornerstone for developing cloud native systems.
