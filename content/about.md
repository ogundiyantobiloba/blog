I am a server-side developer focused on building cloud native infrastructure and distributed systems. I thrive on
solving complex challenges using cloud native tools such as Go, Docker, and Kubernetes. I enjoy creating secure,
scalable, and resilient systems that power modern applications. My work predominantly falls within the DevOps space, where I design, implement, and
maintain robust infrastructure solutions. My passion drives me to explore innovative cloud native technologies and
continuously improve my craft.

I have a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity, which laid a solid foundation in IT and security principles. My academic
journey was further solidified by computer networking certifications that sharpened my understanding of network
architectures and communication protocols, serving as the foundation for developing cloud native systems.
